Hi! Thank you for taking the time to participate in the Cognition Capstone (PSYC 5057)'s experiment! The data collected in this study will be used by students at the University of Cincinnati to better understand the scientific method and to answer questions about how information provided prior to entering a maze might help people navigate it. 

In today's experiment, you will be solving a maze using your keyboard, from a first person game-like perspective. For the experiment, you will be randomly sorted into one of three conditions:

1. Birds Eye View: Prior to the start of the maze, you will be provided a bird's eye view of the maze with the ability to look for how to solve it. You can look at the maze for as long as you would like, but we ask that you do not write down anything that might help you solve the maze.
2. Written Instructions: Prior to the start of the maze, you will be provided written instructions for how to solve the maze. You can look at the instructions for as long as you would like, but we ask that you do not write down anything that might help you solve the maze.
3. No Information: In this condition, you will be put directly into the maze without any added information.

Once you solve the maze, your information will be recorded! By consenting to this experiment, you agree to participate in a classroom experiment at the University of Cincinnati. Any data from this experiment will be anonymous, but may be shared in and outside of the University.
