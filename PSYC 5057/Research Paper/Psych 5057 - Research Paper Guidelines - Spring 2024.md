# APA Requirements
All research papers for this course should be...
- approximately **5-7** pages in length (**excluding citations**)
- **double spaced**
- using 12 point Arial/Times New Roman font
- 1-inch margins on all sides of the paper
- and contain a running header with the title and page number in the upper right hand corner

Purdue University has had a publicly accessible, online guide to APA formatting, a link to the Purdue Online Writing Lab (Purdue OWL), is [here](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html). Use this link to find specific examples & APA format guidelines.

As the rubric below details, you receive 5 points for following APA guidelines. If you follow the guidelines only partially, you may lose all 5 points for "Grammar & APA Style".

# Paper Length
If we wanted to, any paper in this class could end up being really long! 

However, I suggest that you stick to the length of items listed below to put a cap on how much you end up writing:
- `0.5` pages for the Abstract
- `1.5-2` page Introduction
- `0.5-1` page Methods 
- `0.5-1` page Analysis
- `0.5-1` page Results
- `1-2` page Discussion

# Section Descriptions
1. **Abstract:** The abstract is a `special part of this paper`, I want you to use AI at the abstract at the end of writing your paper. The abstract is a concise summary of your research. It should include your research question, methods, main findings, and conclusions. Use AI to make it and have fun with it! Be critical of what it gives you :)
2. **Introduction:** Here, you'll provide a background on your topic, state the purpose of your research, and present your hypotheses. Make sure you include the papers we went over together as a class, be selective with the sources you cite, and the story you're telling.
3. **Methods:** Detail the experiment or study you conducted. Include information about your participants, the measures you used, and the procedures you followed. It should be detailed enough that someone could replicate your study. If you're having trouble coming up with details for the methods section, think about what it was like to set up the experiment and participate in it. 
4. **Analysis:** This is where you explain how you analyzed the data you collected. You should detail the statistical tests you used and why they were appropriate for your research. We will go over an initial analysis together in class (likely an ANOVA or a regression), but I'd like you to supplement your analysis with some additional investigation of your own.
5. **Results:** In this section, present your findings factually **without interpretation**. Use a clear and concise presentation, including figures if relevant.
6. **Discussion:** This is where you interpret your results in depth. You should relate your findings back to your original hypotheses and then to the wider field. Discuss how your results fit in with current knowledge, what new insights they bring, and what questions they might raise for future research.
7. **Citations:** An annotated bibliography. Every claim you make that isn't your own original thought needs to be cited, using the proper APA format. Your sources should be credible and relevant to your study, and each scientific citation needs a summary. You can have used AI to generate these for you, just make sure they're accurate.
8. **Grammar & Proper APA Stylings:** This considers the correct use of grammar, punctuation, and spelling, as well as the proper formatting of the paper per APA standards, such as correct in-text citations, reference list, headings, and overall organization of the paper.
9. **Figures**: Any figures graphs or tables you use for your paper should be in a section at the very end of your paper (after references).
