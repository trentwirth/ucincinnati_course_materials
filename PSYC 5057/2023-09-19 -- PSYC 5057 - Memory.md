The main types of memory discussed in psychological research are:

- Sensory memory - Very brief (milliseconds to seconds) retention of sensory information. Examples include iconic memory for visual stimuli and echoic memory for sounds.
- Short-term/working memory - Temporary storage and manipulation of information for seconds to minutes. Used for cognitive tasks.
- Long-term memory:
	1. Episodic - Memory for autobiographical events and experiences associated with time and place. Provides a sense of mental time travel.
	2. Semantic - Factual knowledge about the world, meaning, and concepts. Our general knowledge.
	3. Procedural - Memory for skills, habits, and procedures for how to do things.

Some other distinctions:

- Declarative vs Non-declarative memory - Declarative includes episodic and semantic memory that can be consciously recalled. Non-declarative includes procedural memory and simple classical conditioning.
- Explicit vs Implicit memory - Explicit memories are intentionally and consciously recalled, while implicit memories influence behavior and performance without conscious awareness.
- Retrospective vs Prospective memory - Retrospective involves remembering past events. Prospective involves remembering to do something in the future.

There are also different stage models of memory such as:

- Encoding - Processing information into a stored form
- Storage - Maintaining information over time
- Retrieval/Recall - Accessing stored information
