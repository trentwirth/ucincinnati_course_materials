## Availability & Contact Information

I (Trent) am available for in-person office hours on an as-needed basis, email me and we can set up a time. I will have open office hours at a regular interval during the week, day and time TBD. For scheduling in person meetings, or for quick questions by email, please email me and put "PSYC 5057" in the subject line. Myself or the Graduate Teaching Assistant will get back to you within a day or two. 

I am happy to meet virtually as well, either by phone, UC meeting tools, FaceTime, or Zoom.
## Class Meeting Information

We will meet in person in **Baldwin 750** on **Tuesdays** and **Thursdays** from **2:00 p.m. to 3:20 p.m.**

## Required Texts

All required reading materials, lecture notes, podcasts, and related materials will be distributed via CANVAS PDFs, MP3s, or links to outside contacts, such as YouTube, etc.
## Course Overview 

This course surveys the disciplines of cognitive psychology **and cognitive science**. It includes topics relating to its historical roots and statistical practices, information processing theory, distributed and embodied cognition, as well as cognitive dynamics, artificial intelligence, and animal cognition. Each class member’s knowledge of, and competency in evaluating these topics will be demonstrated and assessed in assignments and related assignments designed to evaluate the relationships between research outcomes to theoretical principles.

### Learning Objectives

1. Students will gain experience in reviewing/critiquing research and applying major theories and methodologies in the fields of Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Science.
2. Students will be introduced to notable methodological challenges of conducting research and learn strategies for confronting those challenges. 
3. Students will review scientific literature to develop research questions and/or hypotheses.
4. Students will design and plan research projects, including assembling relevant materials, assembling or retrieving data, analyzing the results, and writing APA-style research reports.
5. Students will be able to communicate research results to a wider audience.
6. Students will gain experience using Large Language Models (LLM's) to synthesize, critique, and improve writing.
## Course Structure

For assessment, this course emphasizes three related skills: (1) Evaluations and synthesis of assigned readings. (2) Hands-on research assignments, including hypothesis generation, project planning, data analysis, and perhaps data collection. (3) An APA-style report. 

The course requires the regular submission of brief reading summaries, generated in cooperation with large language models ([LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKndCikg3R0)), and lab assignments. Class members will use a large language model of their choice (I recommend [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), because it is both free to use and high quality) to summarize course readings. Class members will then critique the summary provided by the large language model, and then edit the generated summary – correcting any errors. All prompts used will be copied into the submitted course assignments, which will be submitted either as a Word Document, markdown file, or a PDF. A template overview of what is expected from these LMM-assisted course summaries will be provided to the students by the instructor. 

The evaluation of assignments will be as transparent as possible; rubrics will generally be provided to students prior to the start of assignments.

## Grades

The plus minus system will be used for all final grades. While absolute rubric scores will influence your final grade, the final letter grade for the course will reflect each individuals participation in the course, as well as their individual growth, engagement, and achievement relative to the learning objectives. 

If in my judgment, a reasonable need arises, I reserve the right to adjust the grade for portions, and any other aspect of the syllabus or course. 

### Late Policy

Late assignments are subject to a 5% penalty for each calendar day off to a 10% maximum deduction. For medical or family emergencies, late penalties may be avoided or waved. 

### Academic Integrity

All assignments are expected to reflect the class members on work. All students are expected to adhere to the University's academic integrity standards, and violations of these standards will be handled according with the University's policies. Assignments that include plagiarized content are forbidden. Please familiarize yourself with a good APA, writing practices, standards, and writing styles. See [APA Style Introduction](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html)

Importantly, reading summaries are exempted from certain APA standards. For example: full citations are not needed for course readings, our readings may be referenced by the authors name. 

### Peer Review Notice

Periodically during the semester, we may conduct peer evaluation of materials, written in conjunction with projects. This means that other people will see and critique your writing. These peer evaluations do not figure into your grade. They are designed to give each class member feedback about the clarity and effectiveness of their work. 

## Etiquette and Expectations 

I expect all class members to treat each other with respect, understanding, and care. Ultimately, diversity in our perspectives, identities, and backgrounds helps us all understand ourselves, each other, and our world. Class members engaging in activities contrary to the spirit of the Bearcat Bond will be reported to appropriate UC officials. At the instructor’s discretion, grading of these class members' assignments can be suspended and may result in a failing course grade. 

## Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities that seek accommodation must register with the office of Disability Services and complete a services agreement each term. Staff within the Center will assess and recommend accommodations based on the documentation. Students who are approved for test-taking accommodations must provide the instructor with an accommodation form prior to making testing arrangements. I make every reasonable effort to make the course material accessible to students with disabilities. Any students encountering difficulties accessing course material (e.g., assistive technology not reading class notes) should notify me, and I will see if I can address the difficulty somehow. The Center on disabilities is located in the University Pavilion, room 210 (513-556-6823).

## Policy on Children in Class

The University of Cincinnati does not currently have an official policy on children in the classroom. The policy I lay out here is a reflection of my person belief and commitment to equity in the academy. As a parent myself, I recognize there are times when a parent must decide between being with and caring for there child, or going to class. To eliminate this barrier, I am implementing this policy:
1. All children are welcome! This includes exclusively breastfed babies.
2. I understand that minor illnesses (please do not bring a contagious child to class) and unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.
3. I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your child needs special attention or is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met.

## Absence and accommodations for religious or spiritual observance

Ohio law and the University’s Student Religious Accommodations for Courses Policy 1.3.7 permits a student, upon request, to be absent for reasons of faith or religious or spiritual belief system or participate in organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or other religious or spiritual organization and/or to receive alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other course requirements due to an absence permitted for the above-described reasons. Not later than fourteen days after the first day of instruction in the course, a student should provide the instructor with written notice of the specific dates for which the student requests alternative accommodations.For additional information about this policy, please contact the Executive Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access at (513) 556-5503 or oeohelp@UCMAIL.UC.EDU.
