# Course Overview 

This course surveys the disciplines of *Cognitive Science*, including Cognitive Psychology, Philosophy, and Artificial Intelligence. It includes topics relating to its historical roots and statistical practices, information processing theory and *artificial intelligence* (from here on out, I'll refer to this as "**AI**"). 

The course brings particular focus to the use and integration of AI in our work and daily lives; undoubtedly, the advent of Large Language Model (LLM) chat bots, that can answer questions we might type into Google *directly*, and often times correctly, is going to change the way we as humans access and implement information.

Each class member’s knowledge of the topics covered in this course will be demonstrated and assessed in assignments including but not limited to: worksheets, quizzes, writing, peer review, general participation, and a final paper. 

The components of the final paper will be drafted in the class throughout the semester (e.g.; Intro, Methods, Results, & Discussion). At the end of the semester, students will revise and combine the pieces of the research paper in APA format. There is no final exam.

### Learning Objectives

1. Students will gain experience in reviewing/critiquing research and applying major theories and methodologies in the fields of Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Science.
2. Students will be introduced to notable methodological challenges of conducting research and learn strategies for confronting those challenges. 
3. Students will review scientific literature to develop research questions and/or hypotheses.
4. Students will carry out a research project, including data collection, analyzing the results, and writing APA-style research reports.
5. Students will be able to communicate research results to a wider audience.
6. Students will gain experience using Large Language Models (LLM's) to synthesize, critique, and improve writing, and generate ideas.
## Required Texts

All required reading materials, lecture notes, podcasts, and related materials will be distributed via CANVAS PDFs, MP3s, or links to outside contacts, such as YouTube, etc.

## Course Structure

This class is structured into three parts. In the first part of the class, we'll be diving into theoretical topics of Cognitive Science (including Cognitive Psychology), and participating in Large Language Models "Labs" (I'll refer to this as [LLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKndCikg3R0) Labs) to grow our expertise using LLMs. 

The first part of the course will include 3 different class types:
1. **Seminar**: Students will read papers, come to class and discuss the papers. The conversation will be moderated by the instructor(s).
2. **LLM Lab**: Students will be given a task to complete in cooperation with a large language model, with direction from the instructor. A worksheet will be filled out through class, and submitted at the end.
3. **Experiential Learning**: Students will participate in experiential mini-psychology-experimental exercises. This is meant to turn theory into practice, without the rigorous effort of conducting research.

In the second part of the course, we will conduct an experiment investigating research questions in Spatial Cognition (using maps and wayfinding), and then write an APA style paper on the conducted research.

To support you in this work, we will have a sequence of in-class writing workshops all centered around Spatial Cognition experiment. The writing workshops will prepare you to submit an APA style paper by the end of the semester. This will involve in-class exercises guided by the instructor(s). The writing workshops will cover APA formatting, introductions, methods, results/statistics, discussions, and literature review.

This second part will also include a statistics refresher to assist in your analysis of the data collected in the experiment.

In the third part of this course, you will be *choosing your own adventure,* breaking into small groups to conduct a small research project, build a game using AI, or something else you come up with! 
> The only restriction for the project is that it cannot cost money.
## Grades

The plus minus system will be used for all final grades. While absolute rubric scores will influence your final grade, the final letter grade for the course will reflect each individuals participation in the course, as well as their individual growth, engagement, and achievement relative to the learning objectives. 

If in my judgment, a reasonable need arises, I reserve the right to adjust the grade for portions, and any other aspect of the syllabus or course. 

Here is how each of the different activities will be weighted for your final grade:

| Group         | Weight |
| ------------- | ------ |
| LLM Labs      | 15%    |
| Attendance    | 25%    |
| Final Paper   | 30%    |
| Final Project | 30%    |
#### Note on Attendance

Consistent in-person attendance is critical to the success and learning within the capstone. Getting to hear the ideas of your peers and learn as a group is what makes the Capstone special. Therefore, I want to reward and incentivize attendance, which is why it is such a large proportion of your grade. 

*I do not want you to come to class sick.* If you are unwell, please let me know and I will excuse your absence. If you are sick for a prolonged period of time, we might need to discuss ways for you to make up your lack of in-class participation.
### Late Policy

Late assignments are subject to a 5% penalty for each calendar day off to a 10% maximum deduction. For medical or family emergencies, late penalties may be avoided or waved. 

### Academic Integrity

All assignments are expected to reflect the class members on work. All students are expected to adhere to the University's academic integrity standards, and violations of these standards will be handled according with the University's policies. Assignments that include plagiarized content are forbidden. Please familiarize yourself with a good APA, writing practices, standards, and writing styles. See [APA Style Introduction](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html)

Importantly, reading summaries are exempted from certain APA standards. For example: full citations are not needed for course readings, our readings may be referenced by the authors name. 

### Peer Review Notice

Periodically during the semester, we may conduct peer evaluation of materials, written in conjunction with projects. This means that other people will see and critique your writing. These peer evaluations do not figure into your grade. They are designed to give each class member feedback about the clarity and effectiveness of their work. 

## Etiquette and Expectations 

I expect all class members to treat each other with respect, understanding, and care. Ultimately, diversity in our perspectives, identities, and backgrounds helps us all understand ourselves, each other, and our world. Class members engaging in activities contrary to the spirit of the Bearcat Bond will be reported to appropriate UC officials. At the instructor’s discretion, grading of these class members' assignments can be suspended and may result in a failing course grade. 

## Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities that seek accommodation must register with the office of Disability Services and complete a services agreement each term. Staff within the Center will assess and recommend accommodations based on the documentation. Students who are approved for test-taking accommodations must provide the instructor with an accommodation form prior to making testing arrangements. I make every reasonable effort to make the course material accessible to students with disabilities. Any students encountering difficulties accessing course material (e.g., assistive technology not reading class notes) should notify me, and I will see if I can address the difficulty somehow. The Center on disabilities is located in the University Pavilion, room 210 (513-556-6823).

## Policy on Children in Class

The University of Cincinnati does not currently have an official policy on children in the classroom. The policy I lay out here is a reflection of my person belief and commitment to equity in the academy. As a parent myself, I recognize there are times when a parent must decide between being with and caring for there child, or going to class. To eliminate this barrier, I am implementing this policy:
1. All children are welcome! This includes exclusively breastfed babies.
2. I understand that minor illnesses (please do not bring a contagious child to class) and unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.
3. I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your child needs special attention or is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met.

## Absence and accommodations for religious or spiritual observance

Ohio law and the University’s Student Religious Accommodations for Courses Policy 1.3.7 permits a student, upon request, to be absent for reasons of faith or religious or spiritual belief system or participate in organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or other religious or spiritual organization and/or to receive alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other course requirements due to an absence permitted for the above-described reasons. Not later than fourteen days after the first day of instruction in the course, a student should provide the instructor with written notice of the specific dates for which the student requests alternative accommodations.For additional information about this policy, please contact the Executive Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access at (513) 556-5503 or oeohelp@UCMAIL.UC.EDU.
