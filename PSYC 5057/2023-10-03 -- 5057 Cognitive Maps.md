## Opening Discussion
- What is a Cognitive Map?
	- Define cognitive maps and their key features (survey perspective, configurations, allocentric).
	- Place & Grid Cells

## Map Drawing Activity 1
- Have students draw a sketch map of the campus/Clifton Court Hall.
	- Then, of Campus
- Compare maps in pairs/groups and observe similarities and differences.
- Discuss how map accuracy and detail increase with exposure and familiarity.

## Continued Discussion
- Explain how maps develop over childhood and depend on hippocampal maturation.
- Consider individual and gender differences in mapping abilities.
- Debate whether cognitive maps exist or brain just produces map-like behaviors.

## Map Drawing Activity 2
- Have students draw a map of a route between two familiar locations.
- Discuss how maps allow flexible novel routing, not just habitual paths.
- Relate to preplay/replay of place cell sequences and simulation of future routes.

## Concluding Discussion
- Link cognitive maps to place, response, and cue learning hypotheses.
- Discuss reorientation literature and geometry vs. feature distinction.
- Conclude with computational efficiency of maps providing existence argument.
- Review key points and open up Q&A.
