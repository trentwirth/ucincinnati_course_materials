Trent wants to know:
- what was useful
- what wasn't 
- time input vs. reward output?
- additional practicum desires
- anything else

## Feedback
- practicum in general is useful; motivation to learn what you want to learn
	- without it (the accountability), progress wouldn't have been the same
- weekly group meetings were really helpful - great resource sharing. wouldn't have been tapped into that otherwise
- nothing comes to mind that wasn't "unhelpful"
- great ratio for time input to reward output
	- the act of doing this - at your own pace - provides the space and opportunity to approach problems the way that you want to
- because the meetings are so short, it allows you to put time into the work at your own pace
- desire: more external accountability
	- as the semester goes on, people can be distracted - can use a push to keep going 
	- progress review mid semester and at the end
- flexibility around goals is great 

## Trent Takeaways
- teams isn't effective
	- push discord next semester
	- centralized canvas page
- providing team work opportunities
- agreed that a "practicum lab meeting" would be a good idea
