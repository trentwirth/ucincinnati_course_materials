**Meeting Time:** Asynchronous + Weekly Scrum Meetings (TBD)
**Office Hours:** By Appointment
## Description:
In this course, students are provided the flexible structure to take ownership of their research and professional skill development. This self-directed Research Practicum allows students to identify and pursue personalized learning goals over the semester, working independently or in small groups. Students will shape their own learning, and be given opportunities to collaborate with other students in micro-projects (two week "sprints"), or to pursue their own goals independently. Students might focus on growing their skills in open science (open science literacy, data management & sharing, conducting reproducible science, etc.), systems technologies (motion capture, AR/VR, etc.), or building their resume (learning programming languages, such as Python, SQL, or growing in mixed-method/qualitative research skills that are valued in industry). The course fosters an open and collaborative environment for students to develop public work habits and share their progress. Students will consult with the instructor to establish goals, assess growth, and get personalized mentorship. The flexible format accommodates students at all levels from any discipline. Research Practicum gives students agency in their graduate training, equipping them with cutting-edge and transferable research skills for modern academic and industry careers. The personalized approach supports students holistically to become well-rounded researchers and prepares them for lifelong learning beyond the PhD.

## Course Structure
The goal of this course is to provide a space for doctoral students to receive feedback as they grow. The direction of their growth is determined at the beginning and throughout the semester between the student and the instructor, with potential feedback and collaboration with their peers.

This course involves two main components:
1. Participation in weekly team meetings ("Scrum Meetings") where small groups will meet for 15 minute increments to review progress towards each individual students learning objectives
2. Publicly communicating outside of scrum meetings the progress each student is making towards their learning objectives. Public communication can be defined on anything that is visible to the entire class: teams posts, GitHub posts, social media posts, writing wiki articles, or other miscellaneous presentations.

Students will find success in this course if they take seriously the time they are given to work on their own objectives, and progress towards their goals on a regular basis.
## Grades
This course is taken as pass/fail. The determination of whether or not the student passes the course is dependent on their pursuit of their personalized & agreed upon learning goals for the semester. Learning goals will have been established with the instructor at the beginning of the semester, and are subject to flexibility and change.

## Required Texts
All required reading materials, lecture notes, podcasts, and related materials will be distributed via CANVAS PDFs, MP3s, or links to outside contacts, such as YouTube, etc.

### Peer Review Notice
Periodically during the semester, we may conduct peer evaluation of materials, written in conjunction with projects. This means that other people will see and critique your writing. These peer evaluations do not figure into your grade. They are designed to give each class member feedback about the clarity and effectiveness of their work. 

## Etiquette and Expectations 
I expect all class members to treat each other with respect, understanding, and care. Ultimately, diversity in our perspectives, identities, and backgrounds helps us all understand ourselves, each other, and our world. Class members engaging in activities contrary to the spirit of the Bearcat Bond will be reported to appropriate UC officials. At the instructor’s discretion, grading of these class members' assignments can be suspended and may result in a failing course grade. 

## Students with Disabilities
Students with disabilities that seek accommodation must register with the office of Disability Services and complete a services agreement each term. Staff within the Center will assess and recommend accommodations based on the documentation. Students who are approved for test-taking accommodations must provide the instructor with an accommodation form prior to making testing arrangements. I make every reasonable effort to make the course material accessible to students with disabilities. Any students encountering difficulties accessing course material (e.g., assistive technology not reading class notes) should notify me, and I will see if I can address the difficulty somehow. The Center on disabilities is located in the University Pavilion, room 210 (513-556-6823).

## Policy on Children in Class
The University of Cincinnati does not currently have an official policy on children in the classroom. The policy I lay out here is a reflection of my person belief and commitment to equity in the academy. As a parent myself, I recognize there are times when a parent must decide between being with and caring for there child, or going to class. To eliminate this barrier, I am implementing this policy:
1. All children are welcome! This includes exclusively breastfed babies.
2. I understand that minor illnesses (please do not bring a contagious child to class) and unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.
3. I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your child needs special attention or is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met.

## Absence and accommodations for religious or spiritual observance

Ohio law and the University’s Student Religious Accommodations for Courses Policy 1.3.7 permits a student, upon request, to be absent for reasons of faith or religious or spiritual belief system or participate in organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or other religious or spiritual organization and/or to receive alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other course requirements due to an absence permitted for the above-described reasons. Not later than fourteen days after the first day of instruction in the course, a student should provide the instructor with written notice of the specific dates for which the student requests alternative accommodations.For additional information about this policy, please contact the Executive Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access at (513) 556-5503 or oeohelp@UCMAIL.UC.EDU.
