# Jacquana
- Goal: collect real time data - including location and a "simple health rating", e.g. mapping spots of color to the body ("body mapping")
	- spatial data has been done really simply in other studies
	- people can self-report their location
		- location categories?
	- 1st, 2nd, 3rd spaces
- goal from the class: get enough done to direct MQE's
- milestone to work towards: prototype

# Emily
- Goal: Pilot study where they have 10 puzzles & they're told to solve it
	- looking at the puzzles that are equally difficult
		- looking for 3-4
	- Next version of the study will use those puzzles
- Last time this was done in VR and it took forever to run, Kevin has given Emily iPads and run multiple people at the same time
	- `Issue!!` All of the iPads are locked under different apple id accounts
	- thinking of pivoting to PCs/web browsers
