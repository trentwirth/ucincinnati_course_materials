## Emmanuel Feedback
- **flexibility**, allowed different ideas to surface over the semester
- learn about chatgpt, made coding feel more **accessible**
- the wiki would be cool to see!
	- could be a good opportunity to see what other folks are up to
	- a potential surface for engagement
- building on bits and pieces over the semester would be nice
	- mini projects
- good reward on time put in because it was an opportunity to think holistically about what to build upon
	- the practicum gives headspace for planning
- unrelated uncertainty during the semester impacted how this space was utilized
- enjoyed the practicum overall, enjoyed interacting with folks as a whole
	- occasionally couldn't join calls
- gave teams a try; lol
- more opportunities for connection
- desired: a list of things that Trent is excited in and have expertise in
	- purpose of this is tuning work to optimize feedback
	- additionally, a list of potential projects or project spaces
- highly recommend all the graduate students and remind them that the practicum is available to be taken, and list what they'd sign up for in the spring
	- invite clinical folks

## Trent Takeaways
- Trent's excited about LLM's - always
- wiki things are well underway! Recording a video with Antonio soon
- mini projects are a big yes
- in-person "lab meeting" weekly or every other week
- teams -> discord ; teams calls -> zoom
- a project list + my (Trent's) expertise is a great idea
- make sure clinical folks know they're invited to this practicum
