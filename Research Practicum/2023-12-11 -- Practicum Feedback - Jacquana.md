Trent wants to know:
- what was useful
- what wasn't 
- time input vs. reward output?
- additional practicum desires
- anything else
## Jacquana Feedback
- opportunity to dream âœ¨
	- open-endedness
	- dig deep into places not yet explored
	- pattern-breaking
- Gestalt thinking
	- this class helps to think about how the component pieces are used to complete & build the big picture
	- this has been good from an equity standpoint 
		- equity -> neurodivergence, experiences
	- not made to be some kind of shape
- connects students to technology & more technical research
- interdisciplinary support
- been great to listen to other student's projects, what they're up to (something as simple as what conferences people attend)
- thought grad school would be more collaborative - this sort of "class" is a space for that
- space for graduate students is good
	- more space for graduate students is better!
- helped inspire thoughts for MQE and Dissertation
- excited to do research again
	- "If we want people to stay in academia, they need to be supported like this."
- open to learning "with us"
	- having an instructor dedicated to this space is very helpful
- huge reward to time ratio
	- time felt directed, but it was small. This yielded big results!
- Building the open source resource tool
- Teams
	- if we were more active on it, it became something that was forgotten
## Trent takeaways
- Weekly/some frequency grad student meeting (1 hr long)
- connecting with other researchers/folks at UC
	- 1819 Innovations Lab
- Try switching to discord
	- Discord tutorial!
- use canvas as a link hub
- push that this is a place for true interdisciplinary collaboration
	- hard to argue against this
