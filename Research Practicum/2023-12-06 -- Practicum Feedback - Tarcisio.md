Trent wants to know:
- what was useful
- what wasn't 
- time input vs. reward output?
- additional practicum desires
- anything else

## Feedback
- Most useful thing was keeping track of goals throughout the semester
	- the check-ins created some accountability 
- Aside from the check-ins we should have 1-on-1 times around the semester to build up some skills
	- example: work on data cleanup & help with growing as a programmer
	- deeplabcut/freemocap 1-on-1's
- Tarcisio would end up chatting with other students (e.g., Nicole), and continue the conversation from the practicum
- Dividing the larger group into smaller scrum meetings worked well
- the microsoft teams space wasn't useful
	- use canvas?
- discord?
	- Tarcisio got lost in the amount of tools
- can we revitalize pre-pandemic collaboration? 

## Trent Takeaways
- the wiki will be a useful information hub; tools, methods, etc.
- teams isn't working as a communication hub
- weekly lab meeting? <- Trent realized this semester that y'all don't have lab meetings!
	- student's **informally** present on what they're working on
- canvas page -> use this as a link hub
