# Tarcisio
- working with Teh to wrestle with the data
	- realized that the regression model could be better structured to not lose information from the effects they're looking for
	- current organization loses information about interactions
	- hoping that is the cause of the lack of an interaction effect
	- currently: rebuilding and re-running the model 
- Trent needs to set up Tarcisio with co-pilot in vscode
