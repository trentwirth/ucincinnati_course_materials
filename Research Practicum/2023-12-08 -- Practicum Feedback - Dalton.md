## Feedback
- really enjoyed the commitment level
	- especially true being later in the program
	- it would have been difficult to do intensive things
- have some level of submission; 
	- it's good that nothing was "due"
	- but it would have been nice to submit something
- short meetings were great, but could maybe tolerate more?
	- 30 minutes?
	- enjoyed the sessions that ran over longer
	- can always end early when it's done
- early in the semester, practicum was useful for making progress on things. Later in the semester it was easier to drop
- teams - when people weren't posting, stopped posting himself
	- platform itself wasn't an issue 
	- notification issues that were solved once Trent did "@"
