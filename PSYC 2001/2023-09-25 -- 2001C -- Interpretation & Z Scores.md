- writing up and interpreting results
- writing in APA format; focus today is on that
- talk through the scenario
- quickly explain that a Z-score is a standardized score that allows us to compare data on different scales
- assumptions for data prior before you do your analysis?
	- **they're normally distributed!**
	- what should we do with our data? Plot it! Distribution plot
	- demonstrate distribution plots + display density
	- if we want to know if the data is within the normal limits, we want to check if they're within two standard deviations of normality
		- **skewness** - this is talked about in class
		- **kurtosis** - hasn't been talked about in class
		- we need these in standard deviation units; divide by the Std. Error of Skewness

> Skewness is a measure of asymmetry in your data. If the data is bunched to the left and tails to the right, it's positively skewed; if it's bunched to the right and tails to the left, it's negatively skewed.
> 
> Kurtosis is about the "tailedness" of your data. High kurtosis means a lot of data in the tails, leading to a pointy distribution ("leptokurtic"), while low kurtosis means less data in the tails, causing a flatter distribution ("platykurtic").


- calculate z-scores
- 0 = close to the mean, - is below, + is above

- have them look at the powerpoint:
	- 4 steps
	- APA format considerations
		- rounding
		- *m*, *sd*, *se*
