1. Z-Score allows us to compare two scores to one another
> a z-score is a standardized score that tells you how far a particular data point is from the average of the data set, expressed in terms of standard deviations. It's a way to compare data points from different distributions without having to worry about the original units of measurement.

2. Walk through Z-Scores, Skewness & Kurtosis
	- Show how to get these in JASP

	- Skewness & Kurtosis first; divide the values by their standard error. If the absolute value is < 1.96, then the data is "normal"
	- Refresh on what "Normality means"

	- Calculate Z-Scores in JASP, talk through what it means


3. Go through PPT slides super briefly
