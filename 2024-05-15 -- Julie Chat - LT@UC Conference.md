- `10 minutes` intro to chatbots
	- provide links to people who will be bored
- `25 minutes` Big Think-Pair-Share activity
- Three activities:
	- Provide starting prompts
	- walk around for Q&A 
- `5 minute debrief`
	- highlight what we did
	- provide a template slide
	- Exit Survey
		- How do you plan to use this in your own teaching
		- Would you be willing to share your contact information with me for a follow-up?


## RPT
- need some kind of evidence that you're impacting people's teaching
- contact profs who were in the AI presentation within our own department
	- ask them how they've used chatbots in their work after my presentation
	- not only evidence of use, but that it's been used *well*
- another example - think-pair-share is evidence
