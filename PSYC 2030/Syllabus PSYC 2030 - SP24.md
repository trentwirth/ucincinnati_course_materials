*You do not need to purchase a textbook for this course.* All reading materials, lecture notes, podcasts, and related materials will be distributed via CANVAS PDFs, MP3s, or links to outside contacts, such as YouTube, etc.

## Prerequisites

Enrollment in this course presumes the student has a passing grade in PSYC 1001: Introduction to Psychology (or equivalent)

## Course Overview 

### Learning Objectives

1. Demonstrate knowledge of the human sensory machinery and its role in the processes of  
perception  
2. Describe psychological theories, principles, and concepts relevant to perception   
3. Assess and critically analyze theories, research methods and findings related to  
perceptual psychology  
4. Explain the philosophical and meta-theoretical assumptions that lie behind the differing  
approaches and perspectives in perceptual psychology.
5. Build empathy for those who experience the world differently than you.
## Grades

The plus minus system will be used for all final grades. The instructor reserves the right to amend the syllabus, weekly due dates, assignments, and planned activities. Notice of such announcements will be provided on canvas as far in advance as possible.

Your grade will be made up of work in three categories:

**Attendance: 25%**
**Tests: 40%**
**Reading Responses: 30%**

A detailed explanation of each of these categories is written below:

1. **Attendance.** Attendance for this is graded. For all class sessions (except for test days), a participatory quiz will be used to account for who is in class on any given day. Attendance each day will be worth 5 points, and quizzes will be password protected - meaning that you must be in class to receive the password. If you share a password with a student who is absent, or you try and use a password without attending class, you will be turned in for [Academic Misconduct](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/conduct/academic-integrity.html). 
	- If you are sick, please let me know as soon as possible and I will provide you the opportunity to complete the participatory quiz so you do not miss points due to illness.
	- The same goes for a family, health, or miscellaneous emergency. If you're communicative with me, I will provide you the opportunity to get the attendance points.
2. **Tests.** You will have three tests during the semester that will take place during class time. The tests will not be cumulative. 
	- Each test will have 25 multiple choice questions, as well as two extended responses.
3. **Reading Responses**. You will be given a variety of "reading" responses the semester; while it is listed as reading, the content I have you engage with might not always be written. You may be asked to watch a Ted Talk, read an article, dive into a Wiki page, or learn about Sensation and Perception by some other means. "Reading responses" are a way to assess your ability to identify and retain knowledge from the content that makes up our course.
### Late Policy

Late homework assignments are generally not accepted. If there is an health or family emergency that prevents you from submitting an assignment on time, please let me know as soon as possible.

### Academic Integrity

All students are expected to adhere to the University's academic integrity standards, and violations of these standards will be handled according with the University's policies. Assignments that include plagiarized content, or the use of AI generated content (unless explicitly allowed), are forbidden. 

## Etiquette and Expectations 

I expect all class members to treat each other with respect, understanding, and care. Ultimately, diversity in our perspectives, identities, and backgrounds helps us all understand ourselves, each other, and our world. Class members engaging in activities contrary to the spirit of the Bearcat Bond will be reported to appropriate UC officials. At the instructor’s discretion, grading of these class members' assignments can be suspended and may result in a failing course grade. 

## Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities that seek accommodation must register with the office of Disability Services and complete a services agreement each term. Staff within the Center will assess and recommend accommodations based on the documentation. Students who are approved for test-taking accommodations must provide the instructor with an accommodation form prior to making testing arrangements. I make every reasonable effort to make the course material accessible to students with disabilities. Any students encountering difficulties accessing course material (e.g., assistive technology not reading class notes) should notify me, and I will see if I can address the difficulty somehow. The Center on disabilities is located in the University Pavilion, room 210 (513-556-6823).

## Policy on Children in Class

The University of Cincinnati does not currently have an official policy on children in the classroom. The policy I lay out here is a reflection of my person belief and commitment to equity in the academy. As a parent myself, I recognize there are times when a parent must decide between being with and caring for there child, or going to class. To eliminate this barrier, I am implementing this policy:
1. All children are welcome! This includes exclusively breastfed babies.
2. I understand that minor illnesses (please do not bring a contagious child to class) and unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable.
3. I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your child needs special attention or is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met.

## Absence and accommodations for religious or spiritual observance

Ohio law and the University’s Student Religious Accommodations for Courses Policy 1.3.7 permits a student, upon request, to be absent for reasons of faith or religious or spiritual belief system or participate in organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or other religious or spiritual organization and/or to receive alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other course requirements due to an absence permitted for the above-described reasons. Not later than fourteen days after the first day of instruction in the course, a student should provide the instructor with written notice of the specific dates for which the student requests alternative accommodations.For additional information about this policy, please contact the Executive Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access at (513) 556-5503 or oeohelp@UCMAIL.UC.EDU.
