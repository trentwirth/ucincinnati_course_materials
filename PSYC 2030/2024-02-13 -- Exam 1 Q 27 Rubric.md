two points for clearly explaining what they do

Great example of a 5 point answer; not too complex, and accurate:

Visual information first comes to the eye as light and processed by photoreceptors. The photoreceptors in the back of the eye are rods, located throughout the retina, and cones, located in a cluster on the fovea; these photoreceptors sense information such as light and color. Ganglion cells help with the transfer of visual information from the photoreceptors to the optic nerve which is the pathway for visual information to get to the brain and processed by the LGN and visual cortex of the brain.
