## Course Overview

The course will teach practical programming skills for basic social and behavioral science research. No previous programming skills or experience is required. Using one or more basic scripting languages, you will learn how to (1) program computer controlled experiments, (2) collect data, and (3) explore and visualize data. Coursework will include producing one or more small, research-related programs that will allow you to collect and process data. Topics will cover:

* Basic programming skills
     * Functions, variables, loops and program flow
     * Design patterns: approaching common problems
     * Debugging programs
* Designing data collection instruments
     * Programming computer controlled experiments
     * Automated data collection
     * Reading in data from instruments or devices
* Data exploration and analysis
     * Preparing data for analysis
     * Data visualisation 

This semester, our class in particular will be focusing on Python. Python is a versatile language that is used in a wide variety of fields, from web development to data science. It is also a great language for beginners to learn, as it is easy to read and write.

In the last two weeks of our class, we will culminate our learning with a group project, where you will be implementing a lot of what you've learned! There will be 3 primary options for the project, driven by different tools and goals - though I am open to hear any suggestions for project alternatives. My three recommended tools/systems:

1. [**PsychoPy**](https://psychopy.org/) - A Python library for creating psychology experiments. This project will involve creating a simple experiment in PsychoPy, and then analyzing the data that you collect.
2. [**FreeMoCap**](https://freemocap.org/) - FreeMoCap is a Python based, free and open source motion capture system that I helped build. If you're interested in studying human movement, we can use FreeMoCap to collect and analyze motion data.
3. [**Textualize**](https://textual.textualize.io/) - Textualize is a tool for building Python-based applications that live in your terminal. This is such a fun system that I've used in the past, and I think it is a great place to dig deeper into python development. Think of all the apps you could build!

## Course Structure

For this course, we will meet twice a week. My goal is that every day, there will be a small lecture portion, as well as dedicated time for you to work on the excersizes that I am calling "learning paths". To walk through our learning path, you will be following "Steps", which are basically small chapters in a virtual, web-based textbook. 

Sometimes, these Steps will ask you to perform a task. Other times, you will be directed to a Google Colab Notebook to complete coding exercises. 

## Grades

The plus minus system will be used for all final grades. While absolute rubric scores will influence your final grade, the final letter grade for the course will reflect each individuals participation in the course, as well as their individual growth, engagement, and achievement relative to the learning objectives.

If in my judgment, a reasonable need arises, I reserve the right to adjust the grade for portions, and any other aspect of the syllabus or course.

### Grade Allocation

Your grade is distributed across the following categories:
- Learning Path Participation: 30%
- Quizzes: 25%
- Attendance: 5%
- Midterm: 20%
- Final Project: 20%

### Extra Credit

Programming, in particular, is an amazing opportunity for self-discovery. If at any point you work on or program something really cool, show it to me. I will award up to **3% points** worth of extra credit, that will contribut to your whole grade.

### Late Policy

Late assignments are subject to a 5% penalty for each calendar day off to a 10% maximum deduction. For medical or family emergencies, late penalties may be avoided or waved.
Academic Integrity

All assignments are expected to reflect the class members on work. All students are expected to adhere to the University’s academic integrity standards, and violations of these standards will be handled according with the University’s policies. Assignments that include plagiarized content are forbidden. 
Links to an external site.

Importantly, reading summaries are exempted from certain APA standards. For example: full citations are not needed for course readings, our readings may be referenced by the authors name.

### Peer Review Notice

Periodically during the semester, we may conduct peer evaluation of materials, written in conjunction with projects. This means that other people will see and critique your work. These peer evaluations do not figure into your grade. They are designed to give each class member feedback about the clarity and effectiveness of their work.

## Etiquette and Expectations

I expect all class members to treat each other with respect, understanding, and care. Ultimately, diversity in our perspectives, identities, and backgrounds helps us all understand ourselves, each other, and our world. Class members engaging in activities contrary to the spirit of the Bearcat Bond will be reported to appropriate UC officials. At the instructor’s discretion, grading of these class members’ assignments can be suspended and may result in a failing course grade.

## Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities that seek accommodation must register with the office of Disability Services and complete a services agreement each term. Staff within the Center will assess and recommend accommodations based on the documentation. Students who are approved for test-taking accommodations must provide the instructor with an accommodation form prior to making testing arrangements. I make every reasonable effort to make the course material accessible to students with disabilities. Any students encountering difficulties accessing course material (e.g., assistive technology not reading class notes) should notify me, and I will see if I can address the difficulty somehow. The Center on disabilities is located in the University Pavilion, room 210 (513-556-6823).

## Policy on Children in Class

The University of Cincinnati does not currently have an official policy on children in the classroom. The policy I lay out here is a reflection of my person belief and commitment to equity in the academy. As a parent myself, I recognize there are times when a parent must decide between being with and caring for there child, or going to class. To eliminate this barrier, I am implementing this policy: 1. All children are welcome! This includes exclusively breastfed babies. 2. I understand that minor illnesses (please do not bring a contagious child to class) and unforeseen disruptions in childcare often put parents in the position of having to choose between missing class to stay home with a child. While this is not meant to be a long-term childcare solution, occasionally bringing a child to class in order to cover gaps in care is perfectly acceptable. 3. I ask that all students work with me to create a welcoming environment that is respectful of all forms of diversity, including diversity in parenting status. In all cases where babies and children come to class, I ask that you sit close to the door so that if your child needs special attention or is disrupting learning for other students, you may step outside until their need has been met.

## Absence and accommodations for religious or spiritual observance

Ohio law and the University’s Student Religious Accommodations for Courses Policy 1.3.7 permits a student, upon request, to be absent for reasons of faith or religious or spiritual belief system or participate in organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or other religious or spiritual organization and/or to receive alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other course requirements due to an absence permitted for the above-described reasons. Not later than fourteen days after the first day of instruction in the course, a student should provide the instructor with written notice of the specific dates for which the student requests alternative accommodations.For additional information about this policy, please contact the Executive Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Access at (513) 556-5503 or oeohelp@UCMAIL.UC.EDU.
