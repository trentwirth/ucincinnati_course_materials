> Below are prompts that will help you get an understanding of James J. Gibson's theory of Ecological Psychology and Direct perception. This supplements and builds upon Kaufer & Chemero's 2015 book chapter on the topic.

> The prompts below are the Quoted bullet points. Be sure to have conversations about *all of them* with the [chatbot](https://copilot.microsoft.com), and ask follow-up questions. I've tested these myself, and I think that follow-up questions will be very necessary. If you don't have a specific question in mind, simply ask it to elaborate.
