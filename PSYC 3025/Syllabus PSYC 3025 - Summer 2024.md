### Course discussion board

The discussion board assignments have 3 steps. The first is to read the text(s) and listen to the lectures, then post questions online. The second is to read all the questions and “like” the questions you wish to explore further as a classroom community. The third is to write a reflection (1-2 page double spaced) on the text(s), questions, and class discussions from that week. The steps are broken down in detail below.

Step 1: Questions (10%)

Students will post at least _two_ questions about the assigned readings and course lectures on that week’s discussion board. Students should complete this by 11:59pm on Tuesday of the week assigned.

Step 2: Voting (5%)

Students should then read through all of the questions and quotes posted on this week’s discussion board and decide which questions that they wish to explore further as a community. To do this, students should “like” the questions they find interesting. This will provide a ranking of questions that the class would like to discuss further. This will directly impact the content addressed in video chats posted by the Professor. Students should complete this by 11:59pm on Wednesday of the week assigned.

Step 3: Reflections (25%)

Once the class has explored a set of questions on Thursday, each student is responsible for taking some time to reflect upon the questions and discussions of the week. To do this, each student should pick a question from the discussion board, copy it into a Word document and attempt to answer the question, or reflect on it. If the post was a thought or a position, the reflect can be an argued response to the thought/position. This may entail quoting from the assigned text(s) or referencing outside sources. It may even entail asking new questions or reflecting upon how others discussed the question. Each student should clearly credit the author(s) of the questions they are reflecting upon. The answer should be approximately 1-2 paged double spaced (500-1000 words), 12 point Arial Font. Students should complete this by 11:59pm on Sunday of the week assigned. *This is an assignment that is separate from the discussion board*.

### Short Papers

Students will write two short papers (approx. 1000 words) on topics of their choosing **related to the course material**. The papers should be well-argued and supported by evidence from the readings and other sources. The first paper will be due at the end of week 5, and the second paper will be due at the end of week 11.
