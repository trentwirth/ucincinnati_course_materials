**Note:**  This schedule is subject to change. Updates will be posted on the course website. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Schedule Adjustments:** You'll need to balance oral presentations with other activities and assignments. Some weeks might have a presentation alongside discussion, while others might be dedicated solely to presentations.
*  **Presentation/Peer Review Weeks:** Consider having specific weeks focused on either presentations or peer review to provide dedicated time for these activities.

**Let me know if you want to explore further variations or refinements to this schedule!**
