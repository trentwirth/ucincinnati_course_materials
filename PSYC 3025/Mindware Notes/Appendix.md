> Brief historical overview of the philosophical perspectives that bring us to the current moment. The current moment? `understanding mindfulness using the tools of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence`.

## Dualism
- "Mind things" don't have color, size, physical weight - they seem to be different than the physical things we can interact with
- Based on introspection alone, we might be inclined to conclude that the mind, therefore, is made up of a different *stuff* than physical things.
- This is `dualism`

*Problem*
- this view is uninformative, tells us what the mind is *not*, as opposed to what the mind is.
- still, knowing that the mind is not equal to the physical things we can hold, throw, hug, see, hear, is important. 

### The Three Core Dualism Contenders:
#### 1. Parallelism
`Mind and body are distinct and causally isolated. Neither is capable of affecting the other`.

To explain the illusion of a causal linkage, the theory relies on `synchronization`: Some entity, maybe God, set up two parallel worlds to happen side by side - a physical world and a mental one. "like two ideally accurate clocks set to the same initial time and left to run for eternity"

#### 2. Epiphenomenalism
`Physical world can cause changes in the mental world, but mental cannot impact physical world`. 

The mind is like the exhaust fumes from a car; caused by the engine of the car but unable to impact the car itself.

This feels counter intuitive, because it *feels* like desires cause us to do physical things, the the thought/experience of **thirst** driving us to grab a drink of water. 

#### 3. Interactionism
`Treats the mental and physical as distinct but causally integrated items`.

This perspective avoids the problems of the first two - the most famous form of this is *Cartesian Dualism*. 

#### The question that still remains:

How do two distinct items (mental & physical) interact in a way that makes up a single causal network?

Examples like iron filings and magnetic fields show us that things can interact without physically touching; *Cartesian interactionism is conceptually possible*. So, Clark asks, why give up on Dualism?

### Dualism Downfall
- drugs affect the brain, which change our mental states (physical causing physical brain changes, which in turn cause mental changes)
- evolution of intelligent creatures correlates with evolution in brain structure
- physical damage to the brain disrupts mental functioning
> **Materialism**
`There is only one "stuff".` This argument seems to win on the grounds of simplicity.

`Positive Arguments of Dualism` (below) are unconvincing
- "how could *mere physical stuff* do that?" An argument that in light of materialism, seems to fall flat. How could physical interactions cause something like Gaudi's Cathedral in Barcelona? 
- argument from introspection: our mind *feels different* than physical stuff.
> re-connecting to materialism: until someone shows that a mental experience change is completely unconnected to a bodily state, we don't need to accept that introspection as decisive evidence of dualism. Note: brain imaging makes this even harder; changes in thoughts reflect changes in neural activity.

## Behaviorism
The first major rejection of Dualism came from the "Linguistic Turn", a philosophical puzzle by Gilbert Ryle - interestingly, the behaviorism movement didn't come from the inadequacies of dualism itself.

From Mindware (253):
> Philosophers, Ryle claimed, were failing to see the significance of mental talk, in much the same way as someone fails to see the significance of talk about a university who, on being shown the library and colleges and playing fields and accommodation, goes on to complain, “Yes. I see all that. But where is the university?”

**The University is not something extra, it is *just* the organization of those items.**

Ryle concludes: the mind is not something extra beyond the behavioral manifestations. "Mind-talk is just a way of talking about the organization of the behavior itself."

### The problems of behaviorism (as presented by Clark):

#### 1. Dispositional analysis looks either infinite, or circular
- it would be infinite if we have to list what every given belief will "dispose" an agent to do in every possible situation they could be in
> I, Trent, don't see a problem with this. Who needs to list things? A university isn't a university just because someone comes along and lists out the piece components and what they mean. *They just are.*
-  it would be circular if behavioral dispositions reference other mental states; e.g., Mary (who likes teaching), will continue to teach as long as she is happy and does not believe teaching is ruining her life.
#### 2. Any truth to the "inner sanctum"?
- The dispositional account wants to rule out the internal mental space that is special (the `inner sanctum`), but don't we have internal experiences?
#### 3. Behaviorism is explanatorily shallow.
- If we want to understand why someone loves teaching, we might want to know *how* the person came to love teaching beyond the surface behavior of the teacher.
- "method actors' fallacy" (Putnam 1980): We deny mental experience to anyone who suppresses behavior - this seems ridiculous. Take pain, as an example.

> It seems to me, Trent, that the mistake of this account of behaviorism is to discount *neural behavior* as genuine behavior. If we were to take the behaviorist perspective alongside the idea that neural activity is as worthy of noting as whole-body-in-world activity, we might have a theory that is better. I also don't think the disposition listing is necessary. Importantly: Neural activity will "do its own thing" - often relating to activity of the body but operates at a faster time scale.

## Identity Theory
`Mental states *are* brain processes`

- Schemas (like "minds are brain processes) could be used as a coherent scientific theory
- Identity theory is a schema developed by UT Place, JJC Smar, D Armstrong
	- The job of philosophers (in this case) is **not** to decide whether or not mental states are brain processes.
	- The job of philosophers are to determine *if the schema is possible*.

### Identity Theory Doubts:

#### 1. Leibniz' law problems
`if X=Y, what can be said of X must be able to be said of Y`

*Problem list*
- *Spatial location*. Mental state "I like donuts" is located in the center right of my brain. Does that mean, that the belief, "I like donuts", is located in that same spot?
> I would have said, yes... at least partially. I would have said that the believe that comes from a particular neural organization is technically "located" there. Experienced "there", though we don't have sensory neurons to know where in our brains states are experienced.

- *Truth Value*. A belief may be true or false. How can a brain state be said to be true or false?
> Again, I don't see this as a problem: It is true/false in the same way that a belief is, because they are one in the same. 

- *Sensational content*. A pain may be sharp or tingly, but could a brain state be sharp or tingly?
> This is a weird one: if we consider that the brain state includes the sensations of the perceptual system, then... yes, it is?

- *Authority.* I have authority over my mental states. But I do not seem to have authority over my brain states.
> I would actually say that you don't complete authority over either, this simplifies what brain processes/mental states are.

##### Response to Leibniz' law problems:
One way to respond is to say that it might not *seem* like brain states might be spatially located/true-or-false/sensational/authoritative, but they *are*. 

Leibniz' law is unreliable in contexts that involve peoples beliefs about object properties, rather than what they actually are.

Identity theory survives Leibniz' law! 

*Some sophisticated takes on identity theory are popular today.*

#### 2. Species Chauvinism

A strong reading of ID Theory implies that brain states involving certain fibers/organs are equal to the beliefs themselves.

Example: the firing of C-fibers is associated with pain. Therefore, no being without C-fibers can be in pain. This seems clearly untrue. (Animals, aliens, as examples of this)

A "way out" is to say that each individual brain state is equivalent to the individual sensation; one person's pain is theirs, another's, theirs. Not the same pain, but both can be thought of as pain none-the-less. The way to categorize what mental states are, then, could be by their functional role.

Intro: Putnam & *Functionalism*

## Functionalism
- Dennett's problem: ID theorists had to "explain what all clocks have in common"
- Functionalism: it is their *role, purpose, or function.* (<- this is a scientific schema)

Example: computer programs
- A grocery list app may be written in different computer languages, and run on different pieces of hardware, but functionally it accomplishes the same thing in all instances. It might even look the same.
- The same program can run on different machines.
- The functionalist claim is that the mind is to the body/brain as the program is to the hardware

`Machine Functionalism`: The mind is a program, run (in humans) with the brain as its supporting hardware.

A lot of Mindware focuses on versions of machine functionalism, the appendix won't explore this any further.

## Eliminativism
The question so far has been "What kind of scientific theory (schema) could possibly count as a theory of the mind?" -- Maybe this is the wrong question, wrong starting point because it assumes commonsense ideas about mental states which could be mistaken. 

Example: people used to believe in vampires, ghosts, *ether*. Spending time investigating the scientific schema of "ether" would be a complete waste of time.

New question: **Is the commonsense view of the mind *scientifically sound*?**

`Eliminative Materialists`: Those who believe that the mind is like ether - it doesn't exist.

Most extreme EM's believe that nothing in our commonsense framework of the mind will be preserved; believes, desires, hopes, fears will all be abandoned in a future science of the mind.

Clark: It is extremely hard to make sense of this claim before that future science of the mind is here. Question: can we really drop all of these commonsense ideas? Does their legitimacy depend on finding a place in a scientific theory, or are they valuable by themselves?
