# Chapter 1: Meat Machines: Mindware as software

> It is not that the brain is somehow like a computer: everything is like everything else in some respect or other. It is that neural tissues, synapses, cell assemblies, and all the rest are just nature’s rather wet and sticky way of building a hunk of honest-to-God computing machinery. Mindware, it is then claimed, is found “in” the brain in just the way that software is found “in” the computing system that is running it.

Because of the statement above, this chapter dives into an understanding of computers, and Artificial Intelligence.

- Formal Logics: Systems of rules for manipulating symbols.

> ### What's going on here? (thought for students): Mindware is an attempt to explain how psychology - *thoughts* - come into being. By talking about computations, symbol manipulation that relies on syntactic structure, a system is outlined that could be instantiated in the "meat" of your brain. "Mindware" is to software as the brain is to computer hardware.
> - Example: The Turing Machine (page 11)
>   - The Turing Machine is a thought experiment that details how a physically instantiated entity could "compute". This pre-dates the digitial computer

**`Formal Logics` + `Turing Machine`** = ***"the emergence of a new level of analysis, independent of physics yet mechanistic in spirit . . . a science of structure and function divorced from material substance. (Pylyshyn, 1986, p. 68)"***

John von Neumann -> first invented the physical computer. The advent of the computer was the last piece of the puzzle indicating that the idea above was possible; *this is the foundation of Cognitive Science.*

An idea that emerges out of the success of computer science in the late 1900's: *The computational theory of the mind was right - harder and harder problems were being successfully solved by computers.*

> ### `Problem with Brain = Computer:` 
> "*In practice, it is thus un-likely that we will be able to fully appreciate the formal organization of natural systems without some quite detailed reference to the nature of the neural hardware that provides the supporting implementation.*
> 
> *In general, attention to the nature of real biological hardware looks likely to provide both important clues about and constraints on the kinds of computational strategy used by real brains. This topic is explored in more depth in Chapters 4 through 6.*"

# Summary

**Chapter Summary: "Meat Machines" from Mindware (2000)** 

The chapter titled "Meat Machines" in the book "Mindware" discusses the analogy of the human brain to a machine, specifically to a computer, which processes information through its neural architecture, akin to software running on hardware. This analogy underscores a materialistic view of human cognition, emphasizing that thoughts, emotions, and consciousness are products of physical processes within the brain. 
1. **Main Concepts and Discussions:** 
	- **Human Brain as a Computational Device:** The brain is likened to a "meat machine" that operates similarly to a computer, suggesting that mental processes (mindware) are comparable to software operations. 
	- **Historical Perspective on Brain and Technology Analogy:** The chapter traces how the brain has been compared to various technologies over time (e.g., telegraph, steam engine) to understand its functioning, with the current analogy being that of a computer. 
	- **Functionalism in Cognitive Science:** The idea that what is crucial is not the material substance (meat) of the brain but the functional organization and processes (machine) that result in cognition and consciousness. 
	- **Software and Mindware:** Discusses whether software represents an autonomous level in nature and how mindware might be considered as a form of software, focusing on the independence of algorithms from hardware and the implications for understanding mental processes. 
2. **Key Issues Explored:** 
	- **Thought as Computation:** Why it is compelling to treat thought as a computation, focusing on how physical systems (brains) can generate reason-respecting behavior through computational processes.
	- **Challenges of Computational Theory of Mind:** The distinction between mimicking human behavior through computational means and genuinely modeling the underlying cognitive processes. 
	- **Consciousness and Computationalism:** Questions whether computational systems could genuinely achieve consciousness or if they merely simulate conscious experiences. 
	- **Philosophical Implications:** Engages with philosophical debates around functionalism, machine functionalism, and the physical realization of mental states. 
3. **Critical Examination:** 
	- The chapter critically examines whether the computational approach can fully account for all aspects of human cognition, particularly the qualitative experiences (qualia) associated with consciousness. 
	- It discusses John Searle’s arguments about the limitations of computationalism in explaining consciousness, emphasizing the difference between simulating a mental state and actually having that state. 
1. **Conclusion and Further Questions:** 
	- The chapter leaves open the question of whether consciousness can be fully explained through computational models or if the "material" of the brain (the meat) plays a crucial, non-replicable role in our subjective experiences. 
	- Suggests that while computational models provide valuable insights into certain aspects of cognition, they may not suffice for understanding consciousness in its entirety. This summary captures the essence of the chapter's exploration of the brain as a computational device, the analogy of mindware to software, and the philosophical and scientific challenges in fully understanding human cognition and consciousness through a computational lens.
