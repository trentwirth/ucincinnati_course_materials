# Chapter 1: Meat Machines: Mindware as software

> It is not that the brain is somehow like a computer: everything is like everything else in some respect or other. It is that neural tissues, synapses, cell assemblies, and all the rest are just nature’s rather wet and sticky way of building a hunk of honest-to-God computing machinery. Mindware, it is then claimed, is found “in” the brain in just the way that software is found “in” the computing system that is running it.

Because of the statement above, this chapter dives into an understanding of computers, and Artificial Intelligence.

- Formal Logics: Systems of rules for manipulating symbols.

> ### What's going on here? (thought for students): Mindware is an attempt to explain how psychology - *thoughts* - come into being. By talking about computations, symbol manipulation that relies on syntactic structure, a system is outlined that could be instantiated in the "meat" of your brain. "Mindware" is to software as the brain is to computer hardware.
> - Example: The Turing Machine (page 11)
>   - The Turing Machine is a thought experiment that details how a physically instantiated entity could "compute". This pre-dates the digitial computer

**`Formal Logics` + `Turing Machine`** = ***"the emergence of a new level of analysis, independent of physics yet mechanistic in spirit . . . a science of structure and function divorced from material substance. (Pylyshyn, 1986, p. 68)"***

John von Neumann -> first invented the physical computer. The advent of the computer was the last piece of the puzzle indicating that the idea above was possible; *this is the foundation of Cognitive Science.*

An idea that emerges out of the success of computer science in the late 1900's: *The computational theory of the mind was right - harder and harder problems were being successfully solved by computers.*

> ### `Problem with Brain = Computer:` 
> "*In practice, it is thus un-likely that we will be able to fully appreciate the formal organization of natural systems without some quite detailed reference to the nature of the neural hardware that provides the supporting implementation.*
> 
> *In general, attention to the nature of real biological hardware looks likely to provide both important clues about and constraints on the kinds of computational strategy used by real brains. This topic is explored in more depth in Chapters 4 through 6.*"
