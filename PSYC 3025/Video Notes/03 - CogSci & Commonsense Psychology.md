**Commonsense Psychology**
![[Pasted image 20240517110907.png]]
___
**Fodor's Representational Theory of Mind**
- Commonsense psychological things such as beliefs, thoughts, emotions, desires, etc. are computational attitudes toward internal representations of the world.
- They are truthfully represented in symbolic representations within the mind.
___
**Churchland's Eliminative Materialism**
- *Again,* Commonsense psychological things such as beliefs, thoughts, emotions, desires, etc. are computational attitudes toward internal representations of the world.
- Churchland argues that these things do not correspond to neural processes/activations, and that modern cognitive science/cognitive neuroscience will eventually demonstrate that commonsense psychology is actually an illusion of consciousness
___
**Dennett's Intentional Stance**
- Commonsense psychology is an incredibly useful way to talk about thinking things - because it **successfully predicts behavior**
- * The successful prediction of behavior is the hallmark of good scientific models. 
	- We generally only end up preferring a new model if it is simpler and generates the same prediction, 
	- or it ends up predicting behavior (things) better than previous models
____
- Critically different than Fodor & Churchland: The usefulness of commonsense psychology is independent from whether or not it was caused by internal representations that then caused my behavior.
___
**The beliefs of a thermostat**
This is weird :) 
- Anything that predictively relates to its environment can be said to have beliefs, thoughts, emotions, desires, etc. 
- E.g., the *Thermostat*
___
- A thermostat has a belief about what the current temperature is. If it reads 68 degrees, the thermostat *believes* it is 68 degrees. 
- If the thermostat operates in a way to bring the temperature up to 72 degrees, it *wants* the temperature to be 72 degrees.
___
**Why does this matter?**
- If you think about it, a surprising amount of psychological research accepts Dennett's idea - many psychologists *do not care* how beliefs came into being. They use those beliefs to successfully predict behavior in their research
	- Think of surveys, and other kinds of behavioral research/self-report
___
- If Dennett is wrong, and especially if Churchland is right, then it would mean that almost everything we know about psychological science (and cognitive science) will one day be re-written (*eliminative materialism...*)
