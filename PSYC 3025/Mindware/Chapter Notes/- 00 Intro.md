## Day of a rock, a cat, and Andy Clark.
- we have no reason to believe that the rock is having thoughts, the cat and AC however, we probably want to say they have - or at least their days were more similar

## Mentalistic Discourse

1. The feelings that characterize daily experience (hunger, sadness, desire, and so on)
2. The flow of thoughts and reasons 
3. The meta-flow of thoughts about thoughts (and thoughts about feelings), of reflection on reasons, and so on

### Problem of common sense psychology (Fodor)? Unobservables.

### How can we explain psychological experience - mentalistic discourse, consciousness (<- gad zooks...) with a purely physical story? That is the goal here.

- the views here then are *monistic*, consisting of "one kind of stuff"
- contrast with dualism; e.g., vitalists vs. non-vitalists (vitalism: the belief that living things were made up of different "stuff" than non-living things. It's all atoms.)

*"Mindfulness is just matter, nicely orchestrated"*

## `Clark:` "In the next eleven chapters, I will expand and pursue mindware as matter, nicely orchestrated."
