`Note: These are different than the other notes here, I'm taking notes on this chapter for my own personal reasons :)`

Noë's `enactive perception` perspective nicely bundles up a lot of what I have been thinking about with respect to the work I've done/started with Jon - eye movements sweep over our environment, picking up information as we need it. 

> Perception is not something that happens to us or in us, it is something we do (Noë, 2004)


> ... the interesting claim is that skilled bodily action and perception are in some sense intimately entangled or intermingled. ... perception is *active* (Clark, Mindware 2e)

>Think of a blind person tap-tapping his or her way around a cluttered space, perceiv-ing that space by touch, not all at once, but through time, by skilful probing and movement. This is, or at least ought to be, our paradigm of what perceiving is. (Noë, 2004, p. 1)

> . . . all perception is **touch-like** in this way: perceptual experience acquires content thanks to our possession of bodily skills. What we perceive is determined by what we do (or what we know how to do); it is determined by what we are ready to do . . . we enact our perceptual experience: we act it out. (Noë, 2004, p. 1. Italics in original.)

It resonates with me so deeply to think of "visual perception as touch" -- it succinctly explains my current perspective.

> Even the brute fact that blinks cause temporary blanks at the retinal input may be treated as part of the action-input signature for vision (see O’Regan and Noë, 2001, p. 941), since blinking has no similar effect on touch or audition. 

Thinking about blinks is really cool - there was a paper that came out recently on blinks - maybe I can link to it... Got it! Thanks researchgate :D

My fondness for Noe's perspective starts to depart at the stage of perceptual content (it's not that I begin to disagree with him, I just become less sure):
> . . . the enactive view denies that we represent spatial properties in perception by cor-relating them with kinds of sensation. There is no sensation of roundness or distance, whether tactile, visual or otherwise. When we experience something as a cube in per-ception, we do so because we recognize that its appearance varies (or would vary) as a result of movement, that it exhibits a specific sensorimotor profile. (Noë, 2004, pp. 101–102)

> “*Perception is an activity that requires the exer-cise of knowledge of the ways action affects sensory stimulation*” (Noë, 2007, p. 532; emphasis in original).

Clark goes onto explain the *tactile-visual sensory substitution* hypothesis; if you can experience the variation of perceptual information as richly in one sensory system as you do in another, the perceptual experience becomes identical. This is because our qualitative sensory experience is driven by enaction (the knowledge of how to act within the environment to change perceptual content), not sensation. 

> One possible answer [for why we don't experience color only in our central cone of vision] (which builds nicely on the work on “active vision” dis-cussed previously in Chapter 5) is that the scene appears colored and detailed “all the way out” because we mistake easy accessibility for inner encoding. Thus we implicitly know that we can retrieve color information and finer and finer detail at will, just by moving our heads and eyes so as to scan the scene via a series of rapid eye movements known as saccades. (Clark, Mindware 2e)

This is wild. Could be true! Relies on a *heavy handed representational account*

On visual scene's being "virtually represented":
>  . . . the world is present in experience virtually, the way information from a remote server is present on your desktop. The world is present virtually thanks to the way we are bound to it, in bodies with the right sort of networked connections. The flick of the eye, the turn of the head, the movement of the body, brings us the detail we need as we need it. The world is present virtually thanks to our online, dynamic access to it. (Noë, 2007, p. 420, my emphases)

Clark goes on to say that there is a problem with the "virtually represented" perspective in that it doesn't have a great explanation for phenomenology only provides "experience as potentiality." Noë goes on to argue that "potentiality" is all there is... everything is being virtually represented.

Clark on Noë:
> "there is no contrast between what is truly experienced (what is already locally encoded, as it were) and what is experienced in virtue of potentialities (what is available by online dynamic access). 
> 
> It is far from obvious how this argument is supposed to work."

I think this is past the point of the argument that I care for anymore - because we're getting into a level of phenomenological detail that is outside of the oculormotor realm that I'm interested in. What was so interesting at first about the enactive account was its emphasis on sensory motor information as being a critical component of what makes up our phenomenology. But to say that our phenomenology is *entirely* made up by potentialities sort of paints you into a weird box that's hard to talk your way out of, as Clark dives into.

Wouldn't it be more interesting to say that sensory motor information is an important *piece* of what makes up our phenomenology, rather than the whole enchilada? I'm curious what the Chemero paper say - I'll look at that after this chapter.

Dynamic entanglement: It's important for the enactivist account that information is dynamic, and doesn't adhere to a linear flow; we need to move away from the "input-output picture". There are many authors who argue this perspective (Noë, Hurley, Thompson, Varela, Cosmelli) - Thompson and Varela write (2001) write: 
> We conjecture that consciousness depends crucially on the manner in which brain dynamics are embedded in the somatic and environmental context of the animal’s life, and *therefore that there may be no such thing as a minimal internal neural correlate whose intrinsic properties are sufficient* (Thompson and Varela, 2001, p. 425; my added emphasis)

Our experience is driven the "continous reciprocal causation", where "this kind of complexity is found in 'dense nonlinear systems where all state variables interact with each other, [and] any change in an individual variable becomes inseparable from the state of the entire system' (Cosmelli and Thompson, 2010)."

Sidebar: This is interesting because it claims that neuroscience can never give us a complete picture, because it is necessary to capture the world and bodily state in order to understand what is currently being "experienced" (or to use a word that they'd probably be really happy to use here, represented)

Going back, Clark says that there is one more important piece of the argument: *processes* are sufficient for `conscious experience`, as opposed to snapshots or individual brain states. Even if this were true, Clark argues that it doesn't necessitate Noe's "Strong Sensory Motor" information hypothesis (where all our phenomenology is made up of sensory-motor potentialities). Clark continues to argue that this perspective is completely compatible with the "neural internalist" perspective. I agree. Hurley (1998) argues (in a way that Clark points out as "both murky and more interestingly") that **certain experiences might require a "signature" to be experienced, and that some of these dynamically experienced neural signatures might be impossible to experience without the correct extraneural scaffolding.**
