Here are our AI Prompts for Week 8, Chapter 9 (I mistakenly called last week's prompts chapter 9, but to any discerning eyes it should be clear which chapter we're looking at - I apologize regardless).

Reminder on how the AI Chat Logs will be Graded:
- Ask every questions under the "This week's prompts" header.
- Ask follow up questions to at least 5 of the prompts I've provided you
- Ask a series (3+) of follow-up questions to at least one of the prompts

The purpose of asking you to ask more questions is to `1.` make sure you're understanding everything! and `2.` to give you a comparable *quantity* of material that you might get from reading the textbook itself. I don't want you all to lose out by using the chatbots - ideally I'd like for you to be learning more! This is all experimental and I appreciate your cooperation and enthusiasm thus far!

## Suggested Generic Follow-up questions

- I don't understand `[insert term here]`. Can you explain it in simpler terms?
- Describe your personal interests to the chatbot. Then ask it how the content in that particular chat is relevant to your interests
- "How is this content relevant to an average Psychology Bachelors student?"
- What is the other side of this argument?
- What are some paper topics I could write about, relating to this topic?
- How does this relate to `[insert something else we've talked about or that you're interested in]`?

>There are a lot of "thought experiments" in this week's chapter that are critical to understanding Clark's argument. If you're unfamiliar with thought experiments (we have seen them already in this class, but I think it's worth taking a second to talk about them), it might be worth it for you to ask the chatbot `"What are 'thought experiments' in philosophical writing? What purposes do they serve?"`
## This week's prompts:

>Advice and a reminder: Using [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) on the `Precise` setting will get you the best chatbot results. I personally would not trust the free version of chatgpt as a resource for this assignment. As a student at UC, you should be able to login to use Copilot using your UC email. Let me know if you have questions about this.

- Who is the Philosopher David Chalmers? What is he known for? What are his contributions to the theory of the "Extended Mind"?
- Discuss the basic premise of the extended mind hypothesis by Andy Clark and David Chalmers. How does it challenge traditional views about where the mind ends and the external world begins?
- Explain the concept of "vehicles of content" in cognitive processes. How does distinguishing between content and vehicle help us understand cognitive states?
- Explore the example of Tetris used by Andy Clark and David Chalmers in explaining the "Extended Mind." How do epistemic actions in gameplay illustrate the extended mind concept?
- Explain the Parity Principle proposed in Clark & Chalmers extended mind hypothesis. What does it imply about the tools and technologies we use every day?
- What is the Otto and Inga thought experiment, as portrayed by Andy Clark and David Chalmers. How does this scenario help argue for the extension of mind beyond the brain? Describe how this thought experiment forms the basis of "active externalism."
- Analyze the criteria set by Andy Clark and David Chalmers for something in the external environment to be considered part of the cognitive process.
- Discuss the role of bodily gestures in cognitive processes as described in Andy Clark's Extended Mind theory. How might gestures extend cognitive processes beyond the neural?
- Evaluate the criticisms of the extended mind concept mentioned in the Andy Clark's Mindware, such as the Otto Two-Step and the mark of the cognitive. Explain these criticisms in depth. How do proponents of extended cognition respond to these challenges?
- Relating to Andy Clark's Extended Mind theory, reflect on the notion of cognitive turbodrive systems, such as gesturing and scribbling-for-thinking. How do these activities support the idea of an extended cognitive system?
- Discuss the implications of Andy Clark's Extended Mind theory for understanding the nature of human intelligence and our interaction with technology.
