Here are our AI Prompts for our final week, Mindware Chapter 11, "Prediction Machines".  
Reminder on how the AI Chat Logs will be Graded:  

- Ask every questions under the "This week's prompts" header.  
- Ask follow up questions to at least 5 of the prompts I've provided you  
- Ask a series (3+) of follow-up questions to at least one of the prompts

This week, I've separated the prompts by their "content section." As always, feel free to reach out if you have questions!  


# This weeks prompts:  

### Understanding Predictive Processing Models

1. Describe the core features of the predictive processing model of cognition as presented by Andy Clark. How does this model explain the way our brains process sensory information?
2. Discuss how Bayesian inference is applied in the predictive processing framework. How does the brain use prior knowledge to form expectations and update them based on sensory input?
3. Compare predictive processing with traditional models of perception. How does predictive processing challenge or support previous theories about how we perceive the world?

### Applications and Extensions of Predictive Processing

4. How does the concept of active inference integrate perception and action according to predictive processing? Provide examples of how predictions not only guide perceptions but also motor responses.
5. Explore how the principles of predictive processing could inform the development of more advanced artificial intelligence systems. What aspects of predictive processing are particularly beneficial for AI design?
6. Discuss how predictive processing might influence everyday decision-making and behavior. Can understanding this model change how we think about human errors and decision biases?

### Critical Evaluation and Theoretical Implications

7. What are some of the major critiques of the predictive processing model? How do proponents of the model respond to these criticisms?
8. What is "sensorimotor contingency theory?" Analyze the relationship between sensorimotor contingency theory and predictive processing. How does predictive processing expand or refine our understanding of sensorimotor interactions?
9. Evaluate the argument that internal models are essential for sophisticated cognitive functions (a la Bayesian Inference Theory). What evidence supports or challenges this view within the context of predictive processing?

### Integrative and Comparative Discussions

10. Can you explain how predictive processing explain cross-modal and multimodal sensory effects? Discuss the significance of these effects for understanding brain function.
11. Describe the application of predictive processing theory to non-human species. Based on the current research, what does this model suggest about the cognitive abilities of non-human animals?
12. Explore the philosophical implications of predictive processing theory. How might this model affect our understanding of consciousness or free will?
> If you're not familiar with the concepts of "consciousness" or "free will" - ask the chatbot what those are before you ask question 12!
