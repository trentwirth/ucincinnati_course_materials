This weeks prompts are broken up into sections that reflect the book chapter. You can use each subsequent bullet point as a follow up question within 6 chats, or you can use each bullet point independently.

**Don't forget** to ask follow up questions when you are confused, or when you want to learn more. It's important to remember that talking with chatbots like this is faster, but much less in-depth. To go more in-depth, you *need* to ask questions. The curious aspect of this that I think is fun to explore is the "depth" each of you will find is unique!

## Suggested Generic Follow-up questions

- I don't understand `[insert term here]`. Can you explain it in simpler terms?
- Describe your personal interests to the chatbot. Then ask it how the content in that particular chat is relevant to your interests
- "How is this content relevant to an average Psychology Bachelors student?"
- What is the other side of this argument?
- What are some paper topics I could write about, relating to this topic?
- How does this relate to `[insert something else we've talked about or that you're interested in]`?

## This week's prompts:

1. **Introduction to Cognitive Technology**
   - "What does the term 'cognitive technology' mean based on its usage in Andy Clark's Mindware? Can you identify modern tools or technologies that might be considered cognitive technologies?"
   - "Discuss how cognitive technologies might extend human abilities according to the concept of 'Cognitive Technology' from Andy Clark's Mindware. Can you list any specific examples mentioned or imply similar modern technologies?"
   - "How could cognitive technology (as defined by Andy Clark, Mindware) influence everyday decision-making and tasks. Can you provide a story-like example where technology has enhanced cognitive functions?"

2. **Biological Brains and Cognitive Aids Interaction**
   - "Explain how cognitive aids like sketchpads and computers are said to interact with the biological brain based on Andy Clark's Mindware. What benefits do these interactions provide?"
   - "According to Andy Clark in Mindware, how do cognitive aids support or extend abstract thinking and reasoning? Provide a specific example or consider a hypothetical scenario."
   - "Based on the concept of 'Cognitive Technology' from Andy Clark's Mindware, how might a bartender use differently shaped glasses as cognitive aids to enhance memory and performance?"

3. **Neural Constructivism and Cognitive Symbiosis**
   - "Define neural constructivism as described by Andy Clark in Mindware. How does this concept suggest that the brain evolves in response to environmental interactions?"
   - "What does 'cognitive dovetailing' mean in the context of Andy Clark's Mindware? Discuss how this concept explains the integration of external tools into our cognitive processes."
   - "What are potential implications of a symbiotic relationship between brain development and the use of cognitive aids, as proposed in Andy Clark's Mindware. How might this symbiosis affect the ways humans learn and solve problems?"

4. **Extended Mind Hypothesis**
   - "Explain the 'extended mind hypothesis' as discussed in Andy Clark's Mindware. Why might it be controversial to consider external objects and processes as part of our cognitive process?"
   - "Critically assess the arguments for and against the idea that our minds extend beyond our physical bodies, based on discussions in Mindware. What are some potential philosophical implications?"

5. **Application of Cognitive Technology in Real-world Contexts**
   - "Based on Andy Clark's discussions in Mindware, how do cognitive technologies aid expert performances, such as in bartending or artistic creation?"
   - "Discuss the role of cognitive technology in transforming the artistic process, using examples like sketchpads from Mindware. How does this change the way artists work?"

6. **Future Directions in Cognitive Technology**
   - "Predict future developments in cognitive technology based on the trends discussed in Andy Clark's Mindware. What are potential societal impacts?"
   - "Explore how emerging technologies like bioelectronic implants, Neuralink's new brain implant, and software agents could extend cognitive capacities, as envisioned in Andy Clark's Mindware."
